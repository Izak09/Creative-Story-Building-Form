# Creative-Story-Building-Form

The Creative Story Builder Form is an engaging web application that allows users to input various details into a form, which are then used to generate a fun, customized story. This project leverages HTML forms to capture user input, JavaScript for processing and inserting the inputs into a pre-written story, and CSS to style the page for an enjoyable user experience.

Usage:

1. Use this project to practice working with HTML forms, JavaScript, and CSS.

2. Experiment with different inputs to see how they change the story.

3. Modify the story template or form fields to create your own custom projects.
